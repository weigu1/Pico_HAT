''' pico_hat_i2c.py  weigu.lu
    Raspberry Pi is Master, Pico is slave
    This test program sends the 3 bytes to the Pico, defining how often
    the onboard LED will blink and defining the delay time in ms between
    the toggling (command 0x0A).
    It reads 2x2 bytes from the Arduino (temperature (0x81) and humidity (0x82)
